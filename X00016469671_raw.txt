The image shows a receipt, but due to the quality and angle of the photo, some parts are not clearly legible. However, I can make out some information that is visible:

- At the top left corner, there's a watermark or stamp that reads "OJC MARKETING CONSULTANTS."
- Below that, on the right side of the receipt, it appears to be from a location called "Rocky" and there is a list of items along with their prices. It seems like there are three items listed:
  - Item 1: Cash 70.00
  - Item 2: Rendang 30.00
  - Item 3: Daging 50.00
- In the center, there is a name "Tan Chaye," which might be the customer's name or the vendor's name.
- The total amount paid for the items is 170.00.
- At the bottom of the receipt, there are some illegible figures and numbers, possibly representing additional services or charges.
- The bottom left corner shows a watermark or logo that reads "CICO MANUFAKTUR BHD," which might be a business name or registration details.
- There is also a watermark or logo that reads "HITAMI ADI DAYA JAYA" at the bottom right corner, possibly indicating the owner's name or a slogan related to the business.
- The receipt has a barcode on the top left side.

Please note that due to the image quality and angle, some details might not be entirely accurate.
